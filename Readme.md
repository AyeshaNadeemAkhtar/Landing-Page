# Landing Page Prototype

This is the first prototype of my Landing Page. I plan to make it more responsive and refined in future iterations.

## Technologies Used:
1. **HTML** - For structuring the content.
2. **CSS** - For styling the page.
3. **CSS Flexbox** - To create flexible and responsive layouts.
4. **CSS Properties** - Various properties to enhance readability and user experience.

## Upcoming Improvements:
- Make the page more responsive for different screen sizes.
- Optimize the design to be more concise and user-friendly.
